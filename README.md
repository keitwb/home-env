# Homedir Essentials

A (hopefully) portable collection of dot and bin files that I can use to create
a consistent environment on whatever machines I have an account.

##Usage
After the repo has been cloned somewhere on the target machine (the location of
the working copy does not matter) make symlinks to the files in here as desired.
